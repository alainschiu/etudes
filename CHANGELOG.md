# Changelog

## v0.98.1 — 2026-05-09

### Sync hardening

A pass on the sync layer covering Drive auth, account-sync stability,
and destructive-action confirmations.

#### Drive

- `src/lib/driveAuth.js`: split interactive token request into
  `prepareDriveAuth()` (async, idempotent, called eagerly at app
  boot), `isDriveAuthReady()` (sync check), and
  `requestDriveTokenInteractive()` (sync popup trigger from a user
  gesture). Fixes iOS Safari popup-blocker that has prevented Drive
  Connect from working on iPhone since launch — the previous flow
  had an `await loadGisScript()` between the click and the popup
  call, killing the gesture context even when GIS was already
  loaded.
- `src/App.jsx`: kicks off `prepareDriveAuth()` on mount when
  `isDriveConfigured()`.
- `src/components/modals.jsx`: Connect Google Drive button click
  handler now triggers the popup synchronously. If the user taps
  before auth is ready, surfaces *"Drive auth still loading. Try
  again in a moment."* and primes auth in the background; second
  tap a moment later succeeds.
- `src/lib/driveSync.js`: `lastAttemptedAt` manifest write moved
  inside the try block. A localStorage failure during the
  attempt-write is now caught and increments `consecutiveFailures`
  correctly instead of escaping silently.

#### Destructive confirms

- *Restore from Drive* now opens a destructive confirm before
  replacing local state. Copy: *"Replace local journal with the
  Drive backup? Local changes since the last successful backup will
  be lost. Audio and PDFs already on this device are kept."*
- *Disconnect Drive* now opens a quiet confirm before stopping
  auto-backup. Copy: *"Disconnect Google Drive? Auto-backup will
  stop. Your existing Drive backup is preserved and can be restored
  later."*

#### Account sync — conflict modal trigger fix

The "Sync — both devices have data" modal was firing on every page
load and every ~50 minutes during open sessions, even when local
and cloud were structurally identical. Three combined causes, all
addressed:

- `src/lib/useSupabaseAuth.js`: added `signInEpoch` counter that
  increments only on the initial `getUser()` resolve and on real
  `SIGNED_IN` / `SIGNED_OUT` transitions. `INITIAL_SESSION`,
  `TOKEN_REFRESHED`, and `USER_UPDATED` events no longer trigger
  the conflict-check.
- `src/state/useEtudesState.js`: conflict-check effect now depends
  on `signInEpoch` instead of the `user` reference, eliminating
  false re-runs on token refresh.
- `src/lib/sync.js`: new `structurallyEqual()` helper used in place
  of `JSON.stringify` equality for item overlap detection. Items
  round-tripped through Postgres JSONB no longer false-positive as
  conflicting due to key-order differences.
- `src/state/useEtudesState.js`: silent auto-merge broadened. When
  every shared id is structurally equal, the union of unique items
  merges silently regardless of which side has more. The conflict
  modal is reserved for genuine semantic conflicts.

#### Tests

- `vitest.config.js` + npm scripts `test` / `test:watch`. Pure
  helpers only, ~400 ms.
- 28 tests across `sync.test.js`, `driveStatus.test.js`,
  `driveAuth.test.js` covering `structurallyEqual`,
  `deriveDriveStatus`, `formatRelative`, `formatResumeIn`, and the
  driveAuth surface shape.

#### Versioning

- `package.json` → `0.98.1`
- `src/constants/config.js` → `APP_VERSION = '0.98.1'`
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged.

## v0.98.0 — 2026-05-08

### Drive backup status surface

The Sync tab now carries a quiet, always-visible status line for
Google Drive backup. Replaces the dismissable WARM banner that only
appeared after a failure was already noticed.

Seven derived states cover the lifecycle: *not connected*, *no backup
yet*, *last backup N min ago*, *retrying* after one or two failures,
*backup is failing* after three (WARN), *paused* when the queue
circuit breaker has tripped (WARN), and the warm-up state when
auto-backup is on but nothing has shipped yet.

`pushToDrive` now records `lastAttemptedAt`, `lastFailureAt`,
`lastFailureMessage`, and `consecutiveFailures` on the drive manifest
so the surface can read truth without standing infrastructure. Clicking
**Backup now** while the circuit is paused clears the pause and
retries.

A 60-second tick re-renders the relative time while the Sync tab is
open. No notifications. No copy outside Settings.

### Sync tab cleanup

The Sync tab now visually separates Cloud Account from Drive Backup
(both independent systems, previously presented as a single flow with
thin dividers). All user-facing copy rewritten to remove jargon
(*"Separate from Supabase"*, *"Google Identity Services"*, references
to environment variable names). The decorative `● LOCAL` STORAGE
block removed; the "saved locally" message now lives implicitly in
the signed-out top explainer.

#### IA

- `src/components/modals.jsx · SettingsModal` Sync tab: STORAGE
  block removed. CLOUD ACCOUNT and DRIVE BACKUP now render as two
  distinct sections separated by 24px whitespace (no divider line).
  Top explainer paragraph rewritten and made state-aware (S0
  signed-out copy distinct from S1+ signed-in copy; S1 drops the
  Drive sentence when `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is unset).

#### Copy

- Account eyebrow `ACCOUNT` → `CLOUD ACCOUNT`.
- Drive eyebrow `GOOGLE DRIVE BACKUP` → `DRIVE BACKUP`.
- Email line now appends provider: *"…@gmail.com · signed in with
  Google"* (or `email`). Provider read from
  `user.app_metadata.provider`; falls back to `signed in` if absent.
- *"Last cloud sync …"* → *"Last sync …"* (eyebrow already
  establishes context).
- Drive privacy explainer rewritten and now renders only in the
  not-connected state — once a user has decided, the line is noise.
- Drive-not-configured message no longer mentions
  `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to the user. Original technical string
  preserved behind `import.meta.env.DEV` for developer diagnosis.
- Connect Google Drive button now hidden once connected; Disconnect
  remains the way out.
- Drive button labels shortened: *"Restore from Drive"* → *"Restore"*,
  *"Disconnect Drive"* → *"Disconnect"* (parent eyebrow disambiguates).

#### About

- `src/components/modals.jsx · SettingsModal` About tab: added
  Support row matching the User Guide row pattern — eyebrow on
  the left, `mailto:support@etudes.me` link on the right in IKB.

## v0.97.38 — 2026-05-07

### `useViewport`: tablet → desktop in landscape, mobile in portrait

Refined the v0.97.37 rule. The previous "any touch device →
mobile" caught iPads in landscape too, which wasted the wide
real estate.

New rule (`src/hooks/useViewport.js`):

```
mobile = !touch          → width < 768
       | touch, phone    → always (short edge < 768)
       | touch, tablet   → portrait only (width ≤ height)
```

The 768 short-edge cut-off cleanly separates phones (max short
edge ~430 on iPhone 15 Pro Max) from tablets (every iPad's
short edge is ≥ 768). Listens to a ResizeObserver plus
`(pointer: coarse)` and `(orientation: landscape)` matchMedia
listeners, so rotation and pointer changes re-evaluate.

`CLAUDE.md` updated with the new rule.

## v0.97.37 — 2026-05-07

### `useViewport`: touch-primary → mobile, regardless of width

`src/hooks/useViewport.js` previously branched on
`clientWidth < 768`. On a phone in landscape (e.g. iPhone
14 Pro at 852 × 393) that flipped the entire app to the
desktop layout — desktop footer, desktop drone panel, no
mobile sheets, no swipe gestures.

New rule:
- `isMobile = matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches || clientWidth < 768`.
- Tracked via both a ResizeObserver on `documentElement` and
  a `change` listener on the pointer media query, so plugging
  in a mouse on a tablet (or vice-versa) re-evaluates.

Any device whose primary pointer is touch — phones in any
orientation, tablets — now stays on the mobile UI. Width-only
narrowing of a desktop browser still works as a fallback.

`CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the new rule.

## v0.97.36 — 2026-05-07

### Suppress keyboard tap sound while drone is running

`Footer.jsx · DronePanel + MobileDronePanel` now pass
`onPlay={drone.running ? undefined : (n)=>playPianoNote(...)}`.
The Keyboard atom already no-ops when `onPlay` is unset, so
note selection (`onNoteChange`) is unchanged — only the tap
sample is suppressed while the drone is on.

## v0.97.35 — 2026-05-07

### Piano-ish tap, shimmer drone removed

#### `src/lib/pianoSynth.js` — piano model

The FM-bell experiment from v0.97.34 was replaced with an
additive piano sketch tuned for a brief sustain (~0.6 s):

- Short bandpass-filtered noise burst at the very start as the
  hammer click (4× freq centre, 40 ms decay).
- Triangle fundamental + three sine partials at ×2.002 / 3.008
  / 4.020 (slight inharmonicity ≈ real string stiffness), each
  on its own gain envelope so high partials decay first.
- Master path through a gentle lowpass (cutoff ≈ 8× freq,
  capped at 8 kHz) to take the edge off the partials.
- Same `playPianoNote(freq, opts)` signature, default
  `volume=0.3, sustain=0.6`. No call-site changes.

#### Drone chooser — `shimmer` dropped

`Footer.jsx · DronePanel + MobileDronePanel` now expose
`['sine','triangle','organ']`. The `shimmer` branch in
`useMetronome.js · buildDroneVoice` is removed.

## v0.97.34 — 2026-05-07

### FM-bell keyboard tone + drone timbre chooser

#### `src/lib/pianoSynth.js` — rewritten as FM bell

Previous triangle-plus-sine-stack emulation sounded toy-piano-ish.
Replaced with a single carrier + modulator FM voice:

- Carrier sine at `freq`; 5 ms attack → exp decay over `sustain`
  (default 1.2 s).
- Modulator sine at `freq * 3.5` (inharmonic ratio for bell
  shimmer), routed into the carrier's frequency through a depth
  gain whose value sweeps from `freq * 3` down to `freq * 0.5`
  over 200 ms. Bright on attack, settles into a near-sine tail.
- Same `playPianoNote(freq, opts)` signature — call sites in
  `Footer.jsx` are unchanged.

#### Drone timbre chooser

- `src/hooks/useMetronome.js`: extended initial drone state with
  `sound:'sine'`. Added `buildDroneVoice(ctx, sound, baseFreq)`
  helper returning an array of `{osc, mult, partGain}` partials.
  The `drone.running` effect now builds/tears down the whole
  voice; depending on `drone.sound` it allocates:
  - `sine` — 1× sine
  - `triangle` — 1× triangle
  - `shimmer` — two sines at ±6 ¢ (`2^(±6/1200)`), gain 0.5 each
  - `organ` — sine 1× / 2× / 3× at gains 1 / 0.5 / 0.25,
    normalised by 1/1.75
  All partials feed a master gain. Frequency-update effect
  iterates partials and ramps each to its `baseFreq * mult`
  target. Sound changes are added to the start/stop dep list,
  so switching while running rebuilds the voice with the same
  60 ms gain ramp + 100 ms `osc.stop` defer that already
  handles run-toggles — clean, no clicks.

- `src/components/Footer.jsx`: added `<SoundChips … options=
  ['sine','triangle','shimmer','organ']>` to both panels —
  `RightRow` between Temp. and Volume in `DronePanel`, `Row1`
  between Temperament and Volume in `MobileDronePanel`.
  `SoundChips` was already imported and accepts a custom
  options array, so no edits to `metronomeAtoms.jsx`.

## v0.97.33 — 2026-05-07

### Playable tuner keyboard (mobile + desktop)

The piano keyboard inside the tuner panel now produces a short
piano-ish tone when a key is tapped, as a standalone feedback
sound — independent of the drone oscillator.

#### `src/lib/pianoSynth.js` (new)

- Lazy-singleton `AudioContext`; resumes on first interaction.
- `playPianoNote(freq, {volume, sustain})`: triangle fundamental
  + sine 2× / 3× / 4× partials, attack ≈ 8 ms, two-stage decay,
  ≈ 1.4 s total tail. Pure UI feedback — no scheduling, no state.

#### `metronomeAtoms.jsx · Keyboard`

- Added optional `onPlay(note)` prop. White and sharp keys now
  fire `onPlay` on `onPointerDown` (snappy press) while keeping
  the existing `onClick → onNoteChange` for note selection.

#### `Footer.jsx · DronePanel + MobileDronePanel`

- Both pass `onPlay={(n)=>playPianoNote(noteToFreqFull(n, drone.octave,
  drone.pitchRef, drone.temperament, drone.root))}`. The synth honours
  the current octave, pitch ref (440/415/432) and temperament so what
  you hear matches what the drone would produce.

## v0.97.32 — 2026-05-07

### Mobile tuner: drag-along swipe + handle dash

`Footer.jsx · MobileDronePanel` now mirrors the metronome sheet's
swipe gesture.

- Touch-drag follows the finger via `translateY`; on release past
  60 px (with vertical travel dominating horizontal) the panel
  closes, otherwise it springs back with a 200 ms ease.
- Added the same 42×3 px `LINE_STR` handle dash at the top of the
  panel for a visible swipe affordance.
- Interactive controls (buttons, inputs, sliders, V1 keyboard
  keys) still capture their own gestures unchanged.

## v0.97.31 — 2026-05-07

### Swipe-down-to-close on mobile metronome and tuner

Both bottom-anchored mobile panels now dismiss with a downward
swipe in addition to their close button. Pure UX; no behaviour
changes to either tool.

#### Metronome (`MetronomeSheet.jsx`)

- Touch-drag on the top handle / chevron region translates the
  sheet downward in real time and fades the backdrop. Releasing
  past 80 px snaps closed; otherwise the sheet springs back.
- Chevron-down close button retained.

#### Tuner (`Footer.jsx · MobileDronePanel`)

- Touch-drag anywhere on the panel (excluding interactive
  controls — buttons, sliders, the V1 keyboard) closes the panel
  on release if vertical travel exceeds 60 px and dominates
  horizontal travel.
- Close affordance changed from `X` to `ChevronDown` to match
  the metronome sheet.

## v0.97.29 — 2026-05-07

### Always-visible desktop footer polish

Visual-only pass on the always-visible 64 px desktop footer
(`Footer.jsx`). No behaviour changes; same handlers, same shortcuts.

#### Metronome cluster

- Replaced the hard-to-read 22 px multi-bar mini-strip with the
  mobile widget's beat-bars visualiser (40 px row, accent-aware,
  subdivision sub-bars between beats, IKB on active beat). Lifted
  into a shared `MetroBars` helper used by both desktop chrome and
  the mobile metronome widget.
- The 13 px italic time-sig trigger is now a stacked button — BPM
  in mono 16 px above `{beats}/{noteValue}` in serif italic 18 px
  (matches the mobile widget). Larger click target, much more
  legible. ⚡ icon for accel still sits beside the stack.
- Cluster items (stack, play square, bars, slider + readout) now
  share a horizontal centerline.

#### Stat grid (Aujourd'hui · Section · Status)

- Replaced `justifyContent:space-between` with explicit `gap:6`
  per column and a fixed-height value row. The `Aujourd'hui` mono
  total now stays on the same y-coordinate as the `Section` and
  `Status` totals regardless of optional sub-content (`w/ rest`
  sub-line, `Stop` / `note` buttons). Fixes a long-standing
  left-timer alignment drift.
- Dividers now have symmetric `margin:0 16px` so columns sit
  evenly between separators.

#### Middle cluster (Rest / Record / Tuning)

- Locked label widths so the cluster no longer reflows when state
  text flips (`Record` ↔ `REC` ↔ `Piece` ↔ `Rec piece`,
  `Tuning` ↔ `A4`).
- Shared 32 px height across all three buttons.
- Borders only render on active state — no boxes around idle
  buttons.

## v0.97.28 — 2026-05-06

### Pass 5 V1 — Metronome & Tuner polish (round 2)

Layout and contrast pass on top of the V1 redesign. No behaviour
changes; visual refinements only.

#### Desktop metronome bar

- Background → `BG` (was `SURFACE`) so it reads as part of the page.
- BPM hero vertically centred against the time-signature flip card.
- Tempo / Volume sliders pulled tighter; Italian zone labels
  (Larghetto … Presto) sit closer to the slider track.
- `Pulse` is now a `ModeToggle` (matches the mobile sheet) instead
  of static dots.
- Subdivision chooser restored: segmented `1/4 · 1/8 · 1/16 · triplet`,
  bound to `metronome.subdivision`.
- `auto` / `accel` toggles moved onto the sound row so they line up
  with `click / wood / beep`; col 4 now holds only the transport + tap.
- When `accel` is enabled, its detail panel right-aligns under the
  toggles instead of stretching across the full width under BPM.
- Transport bumped 64 → 70 and right-aligned in its column to match
  the tuner play button.

#### Desktop tuner / drone panel

- Background → `BG`.
- Keyboard hero capped at 520 px wide; vertically stretches from
  the `NOTE` eyebrow to the Volume fader (height: 100 %).
- Play button right-aligned in its column to share an edge with the
  metronome transport.

#### Mobile metronome sheet

- BPM hero vertically centred against the time-signature flip
  (matches desktop).
- Subdivision chooser added (`1/4 · 1/8 · 1/16 · triplet`).
- Pulse / Sub / Accents share a single 14 px vertical rhythm.

#### Mobile tuner / drone panel

- Background → `BG`.

#### Mobile transport row

- Mic / Tuner / Note buttons grouped into a tight cluster (gap 2 px,
  size 30 × 30) so the metronome bar absorbs the freed horizontal
  space.

#### Atom changes

- `SoundChips` accepts a `gap` prop (default 10).
- `AccentToggles` accepts a `gap` prop (default 9).
- `Keyboard` accepts a non-numeric `height` (e.g. `'100%'`); the
  sharps row falls back to `62 %` of parent height in that case.
- Removed dead `PulseDots` / `SubStepper` imports and the unused
  `subOpt` / `noteValOpts` locals from `Footer.jsx`.

## v0.97.27 — 2026-05-04

### Hotfix — RepertoireView mobile detail crash

- **`ReferenceError: confirmDeleteRefTrack is not defined`** when
  rendering `PieceDetailScreen` (mobile Repertoire detail) on a piece
  with a reference track. Same shape as the v0.97.26 bug:
  `confirmDeleteRefTrack` is defined inside the main `RepertoireView`
  body, but `PieceDetailScreen` is a separate function. The wrapper
  was already passed correctly as the `deleteRefTrack` prop at the
  call site (line 309); the bug was inside the body of
  `PieceDetailScreen` (line 895) where `<Waveform>` was passed
  `confirmDeleteRefTrack` directly instead of using the destructured
  `deleteRefTrack` prop. One-line fix.

## v0.97.26 — 2026-05-04

### Hotfix — TodayMobile expand crash

- **`ReferenceError: p is not defined`** when expanding any item in
  TodayView on mobile. Introduced in v0.97.23: I added
  `setConfirmModal={p.setConfirmModal}` to the `SpotsBlock` call inside
  `MobileItemRow`, but `MobileItemRow` is a separate function that
  destructures specific props — `p` is the first parameter of
  `TodayView` only. Threaded `setConfirmModal` properly: added to
  `MobileItemRow`'s destructure, switched the prop value to the
  destructured variable, passed it from `TodayMobile` at the call site.

## v0.97.25 — 2026-05-04

### P2.16, P2.18, P2.20 – P2.23 — small UX papercuts

- **P2.16 — Tab-accept on composer / instrument autocomplete.** Native
  `<datalist>` only commits a highlighted suggestion on Enter; pressing
  Tab loses it. `DebouncedField` accepts a new optional `suggestions`
  prop. On `Tab` (no shift) without an exact match, if exactly one
  suggestion strict-prefix-matches the current draft, the field
  expands to it and commits — the user Tabs again to move on. Wired
  to the Composer and Instrument fields in `RepertoireView`.
- **P2.18 — Folder picker shows the active folder.** `NoteEditor`'s
  category dropdown now renders an IKB `Check` icon next to the
  selected folder (and "No folder"). Tapping a folder still selects
  and closes — but now the active state is unambiguous.
- **P2.20 — Programs piece title `line-clamp-2`.** Long titles like
  *"Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde, arr. for solo piano…"* used to
  flow indefinitely. Capped at two lines with ellipsis.
- **P2.21 — *"From Today"* → *"Save today as routine…"*.** The label
  read like "load today" not "save current arrangement as a new
  routine." Renamed (mobile *"Save today"*, desktop full label) and
  the prompt-modal title shortened to *"Save today as routine."*
- **P2.22 — Past / à venir chip in the program list.** A small italic
  serif chip — `(past)` or `(à venir)` — sits next to the date so the
  list communicates state without a click into the detail view.
- **P2.23 — *"Locked after performance date."* explanation.** When the
  intention textarea swaps to read-only static text, an italic FAINT
  line below now explains why. Previously the field just silently
  stopped accepting input.

P2.19 (mobile sheet/keyboard collision in the Notes editor) deferred —
needs reproduction on a real iPhone before it can be fixed.

## v0.97.24 — 2026-05-04

### SpotEditor — inline PDF page button, fix overflow

- **Trash overflow.** Once N6's `(hover: none)` rule made the
  `target-hover-reveal` cluster always-visible on touch, the desktop
  `SpotEditor` row was clipping the trash icon on narrow column widths
  (no `min-w-0` on the spot-label input meant it never shrank). Added
  `min-w-0` on the input + the main flex row + outer wrapper; tightened
  gap from `gap-3` to `gap-2`.
- **Inline PDF page button.** Added between the time-edit pencil and
  the move arrows — same pattern `SpotRow` uses. Tap an unset spot's
  `📄` icon → 48 px inline number input. Tap a set spot's `📄 N` chip
  to edit; Enter / blur commits, Esc cancels. Removed the redundant
  separate "→ page" row that was below the textarea.

## v0.97.23 — 2026-05-04

### Resilience batch — destructive confirms, mobile editors, hover-reveal on touch

- **N2 — every destructive delete now confirms.** New
  `confirmDestructive(setConfirmModal, message, action)` helper in
  `shared.jsx` (safe to call without `setConfirmModal` — falls through).
  Wraps: note delete, folder delete, spot delete, performance delete,
  tempo log entry delete, reference track delete, routine delete,
  routine session/item delete, program piece remove, PDF bookmark
  delete. Plumbed via `commonProps` (covers spread views) and
  explicitly to ProgramsView/RoutinesView. Tier-2 piece deletion still
  uses the trash + undo flow (now with a visible countdown — see P2.15).
- **N1 — Notes folder management on mobile.** Filter sheet header gains
  an **Edit folders** toggle. In edit mode each user folder shows a
  pencil + WARN-toned trash; reserved folders (All notes / Daily /
  Repertoire) stay read-only. Renaming uses an inline input with
  Enter / Esc; an **+ Add folder** tile appears below.
- **N6 — hover-revealed controls visible on touch.** New
  `@media (hover: none)` rule in `index.css` forces `.target-hover-reveal`
  and `.group .opacity-0` to opacity 1. Covers SpotEditor / SpotRow /
  TargetEdit / PdfDrawer / bookmark controls. The
  `PieceRecordingsPanel` trash specifically had its hover wrapper
  removed so the catch-22 (touch users could only delete locked
  recordings, but locked recordings can't be deleted) is gone.
- **P2.3 + N5 — Mobile editors debounced.** PieceDetailScreen's title,
  movement, collection, composer, catalog, instrument, length, and
  tempo inputs now use `DebouncedField` (400 ms commit, 1.5 s "saved"
  cue). NotesMobile title input too. Markdown bodies were already
  buffered by CodeMirror.
- **P2.14 — UpdatePrompt copy.** *"A new version is ready."* →
  *"Update available."* in italic serif.
- **P2.15 — UndoToast countdown.** A 1.5 px IKB underline at the bottom
  of the toast shrinks from 100 % to 0 % over 8 s, matching the actual
  trash auto-purge timeout. New `@keyframes undo-shrink` in App.jsx's
  inline `<style>` block.

## v0.97.22 — 2026-05-04

### TodayMobile section header — restore Add section, tighten ⋮ spacing

- Restored the **+ Add section** button (with sub-popover listing hidden
  default section types) at the bottom of the mobile session list.
- Dropped the hairline `borderLeft` between the time and `⋮` button on
  each section header; tightened the toggle-button right padding
  (20 → 4 px) and `⋮` `minWidth` (44 → 40 px) so practice time sits
  ~4 px from the icon, no internal divider.

## v0.97.20 — 2026-05-04

### P1.4 — the real fix (in `TodayMobile`, not the dead-code popover below the early return)

- Earlier "P1.4" commits put the `⋮` popover in `TodayView`'s desktop
  branch, below `if(isMobile){return <TodayMobile/>}`, where it never
  rendered on a phone. The popover is now in `TodayMobile`'s own
  section header — toggle button + `⋮` button in a flex row (no nested
  buttons). New `overflowSessionId` state. Popover lists Mark warm-up,
  Move up, Move down, Hide section, Set target. *Set target* opens the
  existing `PromptModal` for minutes. The five missing handlers
  (`moveSession`, `hideSession`, `toggleSessionWarmup`, `setSessionTarget`,
  `addSessionType`) are now actually destructured from `p` — they were
  passed via `{...p}` but never used.
- **P1.5 — `WARN` token usage.** Replaced 11 hardcoded `#E07A7A`
  literals with the `WARN` token. `Footer.jsx` (8 sites in the drone
  cents-offset indicators) and `modals.jsx` (storage warning, sync
  error, auth error).
- **N4 — early-return signposts.** Added a *"Desktop branch — mobile
  fixes belong in [Component]Mobile above"* comment at the four
  early-return sites (TodayView:107, NotesView:254, RepertoireView:252,
  LogsView:26).

## v0.97.19 — 2026-05-04

### Wiki link click no longer reloads the page

- React-markdown v10's default `urlTransform` strips schemes outside its
  allow-list (http/https/mailto/tel/ircs/irc/gopher). Our custom
  `wiki://` / `etudes://` / `wikilink://` were getting blanked to `""`,
  the fallback branch in our custom `<a>` rendered `<a href="">`, and
  clicking that reloads the current page (which lands on the default
  `view='today'`). New `wikiUrlTransform` helper in three files lets
  custom schemes pass through and falls back to `defaultUrlTransform`
  for everything else. Applied to NotesView desktop preview
  (`wiki://`), NotesView mobile preview (`etudes://`), ProgramsView
  body preview (`wiki://`), and `shared.jsx MarkdownField` readOnly
  path (`wikilink://` — used by every TodayView / Repertoire / Review
  reflection field).

## v0.97.18 — 2026-05-04

### A/B trash + PDF page link from spots

- **A/B trash no longer collapses the editor.** `RepertoireView`'s and
  `TodayView`'s click-outside `mousedown` handlers were firing for
  clicks on overlay modals above them (because `ConfirmModal` lives in
  a `fixed z-50` portal-style layer outside the editor's DOM).
  Confirming a destructive action like *delete recording* therefore
  looked like a click outside the editor and collapsed it. Both
  handlers now early-return when the click target is inside any
  `.fixed.inset-0.z-50` modal layer. The A/B bar still clears via the
  P2.8 cleanup `useEffect`, but the editor stays open.
- **Link a spot to a PDF page from outside the PDF drawer.** `SpotRow`
  accepts `onPdfPageSet`. When set, the row shows a small
  `FileText` icon: tap → inline page input → Enter / blur to commit,
  Esc to cancel. If a page is already set, the chip displays it; tap
  jumps if `onPdfPageJump` is wired (PDF drawer), otherwise opens the
  editor inline. `SpotsBlock` (TodayView) and `SpotEditor` (Repertoire
  + mobile detail) both wired through.

## v0.97.17 — 2026-05-04

### Wiki link, day rollover, Programs/Routines list reorder

- **P2.4 — day-rollover banner now fires unconditionally.** Dropped
  the `hadActive` guard. The "New day — timer reset" message in the
  footer status row appears on every midnight rollover, regardless of
  whether an item was active. Smoke test reduces to "set
  `etudes-lastActiveDate` to yesterday + reload".
- **P2.7 — broken wiki links unmistakably plain text.** Unresolved
  links now render as italic FAINT prose — no underline, no border,
  default cursor. Reads as the phrase the user typed, not a click
  affordance. Tooltip *"no match"* kept. Applied across all three
  render paths (`shared.jsx MarkdownComponents` / NotesView desktop /
  NotesView mobile / ProgramsView body).
- **NEW — drag-to-reorder Programs list.** `ProgramsList` drops the
  auto-sort by date and renders programs in array order. Desktop:
  drag any row to reorder; grip appears on hover. Mobile: paired ↑↓
  chevron cluster at the right of each row.
- **NEW — drag-to-reorder Routines list.** Same mechanism. Desktop:
  drag the entire row (disabled while expanded or being renamed).
  Mobile: ↑↓ buttons next to the LOAD button.

## v0.97.16 — 2026-05-04

### Wiki resolve everywhere, mobile deep-link, drop Esc-revert, settings tabs

- **P2.3 follow-up — drop Esc-to-revert in `DebouncedField`.** 400 ms
  debounce was faster than reaction time and Esc has no analogue on
  touch. Browser-level undo still works on the in-flight draft. Saved
  indicator + debounced commit kept.
- **P2.7 follow-up — three render paths, not two.** `MarkdownComponents`
  in `shared.jsx` now resolves `wikilink://` at render using
  `completionData`; unresolved → MUTED + dotted. Covers every
  `MarkdownField` callsite — TodayView Today/Notes, Repertoire item
  notes, Review reflections. NotesView mobile `etudes://` pre-processor
  was missing `encodeURIComponent`, breaking links with spaces; fixed.
  `NotesMobile handleMobileWikiClick` was passing the resolved object
  up to App's handler that expects a raw string — silent fail on every
  mobile wiki click. Fixed.
- **P2.7 deep-link routing.** `RepertoireView`'s `expandedItemId` effect
  now reactive; on mobile it sets `mobileDetailId` so a wiki-link click
  lands the user in the piece editor, not the list.
- **P2.6 follow-up — destructive tone visible on mobile.**
  `ConfirmModal` destructive variant: WARN tone always-on (touch has no
  hover); hover deepens the background with WARN_SOFT. Repertoire
  *Delete* buttons (desktop + mobile detail) styled WARN. Dev *Clear
  all data* button is WARN-toned.
- **Settings tab strip.** Tighter `px-8` → 16 px and `mr-5` → 14 px so
  all 5 tabs fit on a 360 px modal. `overflow-x-auto` retained as
  fallback.

## v0.97.15 — 2026-05-04

### Resilience & input-feedback batch (X3, P2.2–P2.9)

- **X3 — global error boundary.** New `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`
  wraps the view router in `App.jsx`. Catches render-time throws and
  offers **Reload** + **Export backup** so users still have a recovery
  path if a view crashes.
- **P2.2 — `--footer-height` first-paint flash.** `index.css` now sets
  the var at `:root` (116 px desktop, 96 px mobile via media query).
  Removes the 160 px phantom bottom padding before Footer's
  ResizeObserver fires.
- **P2.3 — Repertoire inline edits.** New `DebouncedField` helper in
  `shared.jsx` (later refined in 0.97.16): 400 ms debounce, "saved"
  cue. Applied to title, movement, collection, catalog, composer,
  author, instrument, arranger.
- **P2.4 — day rollover signal.** New `dayJustRolled` flag in the state
  hook; consumed by Footer's status row, which shows
  *"New day — timer reset"* in place of the missing item label.
- **P2.5 — dev panel `window.confirm`.** Settings → Debug → *Clear all
  data* now uses a destructive `ConfirmModal` instead of native confirm.
- **P2.6 — `ConfirmModal` `isDestructive`.** New `WARN`/`WARN_SOFT`
  tokens (`#E07A7A`). Applied to: replace today's recording (daily +
  per-piece), delete recording (daily + per-piece), Replace everything
  on import, Remove PDF, Clear all data.
- **P2.7 — broken wiki-links resolve at render.** First pass:
  `NotesView` desktop and `ProgramsView` markdown previews resolve
  `wiki://` and apply unresolved styling.
- **P2.8 — A/B comparison cleanup.** New `useEffect` in
  `RepertoireView` watches `items` + `pieceRecordingMeta` against
  `globalAbA` / `globalAbB` and nullifies any slot whose referent is
  gone.
- **P2.9 — PdfViewer page input.** Switched `type="text"` → `type="number"`
  with explicit `min`/`max` (`clampStart`…`effectiveEnd`); parsed value
  clamped on Enter / blur. Typing 999 in a 10-page PDF now jumps to
  page 10 instead of going blank.

## v0.97.14 — 2026-05-04

### Two long-standing mobile overflow bugs

Both predate the audit branch (blame: 2026-04-29) but became more
visible after `?` started routing through Settings.

- **Settings tab strip clipped ABOUT.** Five `shrink-0` tabs at ~340 px
  total + 64 px modal padding overflowed a 360 px phone modal. Added
  `overflow-x-auto etudes-scroll` to the strip.
- **Recording panel "Lock oldest" pushed page off-screen.** When the
  rack hit 10/10 the warning text + Lock-oldest button (both
  `shrink-0`) overflowed the viewport, making the whole page
  horizontally draggable. Switched the row to `flex-wrap`.

## v0.97.13 — 2026-05-04

### Mobile composer/instrument filter + visibility boost

- **`P1.12` follow-up — composer filter no-op on mobile.** The mobile
  sidebar facets at `RepertoireView.jsx:672–673` had
  `onSelect={(v)=>{}}` and the matching setters were never passed down.
  Wired `setFilterComposer` / `setFilterInstrument` through
  `MobileRepertoireList` → `SidebarFacet`.
- **P1.4 / P1.2 follow-up — make mobile editing controls clearly
  visible.** TodayView ⋮ trigger and Programs reorder buttons went from
  `color: FAINT` (too subtle on near-black) to `MUTED` with an
  explicit border. Larger glyph (16 → 20 px). *(Note: the TodayView
  popover was still in dead code below the early return — fully fixed
  in 0.97.20.)*

## v0.97.12 — 2026-05-03

### Mobile & wiki-link improvements

- **`[[wiki-links]]` clickable everywhere** — `MarkdownField` (read-only and edit modes) and `MarkdownEditor` now fire navigation on tap/click in every view: Today notes, daily/weekly/monthly reflections, Répertoire pinned notes and log entries, Programs body. In read-only mode `[[text]]` is preprocessed to a tappable inline link; in edit mode the CodeMirror `touchstart` handler fires on iOS. Navigation resolves the link and jumps to the correct view (day → Logs, item/spot → Répertoire, program → Programs, note → Notes).
- **Wiki-link autocomplete fixed** — `MarkdownField` now forwards `completionData` (`items`, `history`, `programs`, `notes`) to the CodeMirror autocomplete source. `App.jsx` builds `wikiCompletionData` once and passes it through `commonProps` so all views receive it automatically — no per-call-site data fetching needed.
- **Obsidian-style autocomplete filtering** — `scoreMatch` rewritten with word-prefix scoring so typing `[[2` surfaces dates and titles whose words start with `2`; `filter: false` on the `CompletionResult` prevents CodeMirror's own fuzzy pass from overriding the results.
- **"Edit in Répertoire" on mobile today** — Expanded item row in Today (mobile) now has an action footer matching the desktop: **Edit in Répertoire** button (navigates to Répertoire with the item pre-expanded) and **Pin / ★ En cours** toggle.
- **Recordings tab default** — Mobile piece detail screen (Répertoire) opens on the **Recordings** tab instead of Spots; the recordings accordion inside `PieceRecordingsPanel` also defaults to open.
- **Tap title to scroll to top** — Tapping the "Études" wordmark in the mobile TopBar smooth-scrolls the current view back to the top, matching the native iOS/Android title-bar convention.
- **Scroll drift fixed** — `html` and `body` now carry `overflow: hidden; overscroll-behavior: none` and the main scroll container uses `overscroll-behavior: contain`, eliminating the iOS rubber-band body bleed-through that caused the page to drift when scrolling in Répertoire and other long lists.

## v0.97.11 — 2026-05-03

### Google Drive — sync layer hardening

- **Conflict detection NaN guard** — `pullJournalFromDrive`: `Date.parse()` result on remote/local timestamps validated with `Number.isFinite`; malformed RFC3339 strings no longer silently suppress the conflict prompt (treated as `Infinity` gap, always prompts).
- **Circuit breaker persistence** ([`driveQueueCircuit.js`](src/lib/driveQueueCircuit.js)) — `pausedUntil` and `pauseMessage` written to `localStorage` (`etudes-driveCircuit`) when a rate-limit cooldown is set; restored on the first `getDriveQueueCircuitState()` call after a page reload; cleared by `clearDriveQueueCircuitPause()`. Previously the 5-minute pause was lost on reload.
- **Blob restore failure visibility** — `restoreBlobsFromDrive` ([`driveSync.js`](src/lib/driveSync.js)) now returns `{ failed: [{ns, store, key}] }` instead of `void`; `useDriveSync` tracks the count and surfaces it in Settings → Sync as a quiet italic note after restore completes (*"N files could not be restored from Drive."*). Partial restores are still accepted; this makes failures visible.
- **`null` confirmFn documented** ([`driveSync.js`](src/lib/driveSync.js) `restoreManifestFromDriveIfNeeded`) — inline comment clarifies that passing `null` auto-proceeds without user confirmation, which is safe because the function only runs past its early-return guard when the local manifest is blank.

## v0.97.10 — 2026-05-03

### Google Drive — Phase 3+ (journal push/pull/restore)

- **`journalPayload.js`** — `buildFullJournalPayload` / `applyJournalPayload` shared by JSON backup and Drive; JSON export includes `programs`.
- **`driveApi.js`** — metadata, multipart create, media update, binary download helpers (still using `driveFetchRaw` backoff).
- **`driveSync.js`** — `pushToDrive` (single-flight, `full` coalescing), `pullJournalFromDrive`, `restoreBlobsFromDrive`, manifest snapshot on Drive; integrates **`notifyDriveQueueOperationResult`** on push completion/failure.
- **`useDriveSync.js`** — 10 min JSON + 30 s debounced blob push, `driveBackgroundError`, restore path; **`useEtudesState`** + **`useRecording`** / PDF / ref-track `notifyBlobWrite`.
- **UI** — **`DriveConflictModal`**; Sync tab: backup/restore/auto-backup, `onSyncTabVisible` pull check; `formatDriveOAuthError` coerces non-string errors.

### Google Drive — pre–Phase 3 hardening

- **Silent renewal spike (dev)** — [`driveAuth.js`](src/lib/driveAuth.js): optional `VITE_DRIVE_TOKEN_TTL_SEC` (dev only) shortens cached token lifetime; [`spikeSilentDriveRenewal`](src/lib/driveSync.js) exercises **only** `getDriveAccessToken({ interactive: false })` + Drive `about`. Settings → Sync (dev): **Test silent renewal** / **Force expire token**. README documents the merge gate.
- **Queue circuit breaker (scaffold)** — [`driveQueueCircuit.js`](src/lib/driveQueueCircuit.js): after **3** consecutive [`DriveRateLimitExhausted`](src/lib/driveApi.js) outcomes, pause **5 minutes** with user-facing message; re-exported from [`driveSync.js`](src/lib/driveSync.js). Phase 3 bulk queue must call `notifyDriveQueueOperationResult` per operation.
- **`DriveRateLimitExhausted`** — thrown when per-request backoff exhausts on rate-limit 403s ([`driveApi.js`](src/lib/driveApi.js)).
- **OAuth copy** — [`driveOAuthMessages.js`](src/lib/driveOAuthMessages.js) maps common GIS errors to plain English for Settings.
- **Manifest invariants** — JSDoc on [`driveManifest.js`](src/lib/driveManifest.js): namespaced `driveFileIndex` keys, `schemaVersion`, `journalRemoteModifiedTime` semantics.

## v0.97.9 — 2026-05-03

### Google Drive backup (foundation)

- **GIS + Drive API** — [`driveAuth.js`](src/lib/driveAuth.js): Google Identity Services token client, `drive.file` scope, in-memory access token, silent renewal via empty `prompt` when a token already exists; [`driveApi.js`](src/lib/driveApi.js): centralized `fetch` with **401** handling and **exponential backoff + jitter** on **403** `rateLimitExceeded` / `userRateLimitExceeded`.
- **Manifest + probe** — [`driveManifest.js`](src/lib/driveManifest.js) (`etudes-driveManifest`); [`driveSync.js`](src/lib/driveSync.js) `probeDriveConnection()` (Drive `about` user).
- **Settings → Sync** — “Google Drive backup” block: **Connect Google Drive** / **Disconnect** when `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set (placeholder copy until full push/restore ships).
- **Env** — [`src/vite-env.d.ts`](src/vite-env.d.ts) documents `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.

### Auth

- **Apple Sign-In removed** — Supabase Apple OAuth button and `signInWithApple` removed from [`useSupabaseAuth.js`](src/lib/useSupabaseAuth.js) and [`useEtudesState.js`](src/state/useEtudesState.js).

## v0.97.8 — 2026-05-02

### PWA / service worker

- **Mobile TopBar — offline** — [`TopBar.jsx`](src/components/TopBar.jsx) listens to `window` `online` / `offline` and shows a compact **Offline** chip (wifi-off + label) to the left of settings when there is no network (installed PWA and flaky connections).
- **Update UX** — `registerType: 'prompt'`, `injectRegister: false`, `workbox.skipWaiting: false` in [`vite.config.js`](vite.config.js); single registration via `useRegisterSW` from `virtual:pwa-register/react` in new [`UpdatePrompt.jsx`](src/components/UpdatePrompt.jsx) (mounted in [`App.jsx`](src/App.jsx)): bottom bar when a new worker is waiting, **Reload** / **Later**.
- **Precache** — `globPatterns` extended with `mjs` so `pdf.worker.min.*.mjs` is included in the Workbox precache for offline PDF viewing.
- **Web manifest** — [`public/site.webmanifest`](public/site.webmanifest): `id`, `scope`, `lang`, `description` (icon `purpose` unchanged pending Android QA).

## v0.97.7 — 2026-05-02

### Metronome — timing, audio, and UI

- **BPM and note value** — `calcSubMs` uses `beatInQuarters` from `noteValue` so BPM follows the selected denominator (quarter / eighth / half / sixteenth) and compound mode uses the dotted beat unit (`compoundGroup > 1`).
- **Scheduler stability** — metronome `useEffect` depends only on `running`; beats, subdivision, sound, compound, accel, and note value sync through refs so changing controls does not tear down the look-ahead loop or reset phase.
- **Live grid after auto-compound** — `schedule()` reads `subRef` / `compoundRef` (and nested `calcSubMs`) each tick so subdivisions apply immediately after the sheet folds 6/9/12/15 into triple compound without stop/start.
- **RAF dedupe** — `lastShownBeatTimeRef` so `setCurrentBeat` fires once per scheduled event, not every animation frame.
- **Click sound** — shorter gain envelope (12 ms); **click** timbre mixes a short white-noise burst with the oscillator to reduce pitched “note” bleed; wood/beep keep oscillator-only with the shorter decay.
- **Accent pattern** — optional `accentPattern` (beat indices for medium accents); **Accent** row in mobile sheet and desktop footer metronome panel when `beats > 2`; shared [`MetronomeAccentEditor.jsx`](src/components/MetronomeAccentEditor.jsx); pattern trimmed when beat count drops; scheduler and mobile footer bar heights follow custom accents when set.
- **Compound auto** — fold to triple compound (beats ÷ 3, sub 3, group 3) runs **only when turning Auto from Off to On** while beats are 6/9/12/15, Sub 1, and Group Off; changing beats to 6 with Auto already on no longer forces 6 → 2.
- **Note value vs fold** — changing **Note** (e.g. to 8) alone never auto-collapses beats; no passive `useEffect` on `noteValue` for compound fold (QA: beats 6 + Sub 1 + Group 0, then change note — count stays 6 until **Auto On**).
- **Auto toggle** — correct on/off handling and optional expand of a prior auto-fold when turning Auto off then on again.
- **Metronome sheet (mobile)** — numeric subdivision labels (1–4 + dotted); copy for Auto; BPM/tap/handle hierarchy tweaks; **meter preset buttons removed** in favour of Auto + manual Beats/Sub/Group.
- **Footer (mobile)** — beat visualiser uses thicker vertical bars and taller downbeats; compound grouping heights preserved when not using a custom accent pattern; desktop sheet Sub labels match; desktop expanded panel includes accent editor when `beats > 2`.

## v0.97.6 — 2026-05-01

### Mobile — Sprint Patch

#### Metronome
- **Widget redesign** — zones 1+2 merged into one `<button>`: beat bars fill the left region (`flex:1`), BPM + time sig (`16px serif`) sit in a fixed 46 px right column, chevron remains for sheet access. Single touch anywhere left of the chevron toggles on/off.
- **Pulse mode** — `metronome.visualMode: 'bars' | 'pulse'` (new field, not persisted). In pulse mode the entire left zone flashes IKB on beat 1 and a dimmer blue on other beats; flash duration is 90 ms with a 200 ms ease-out decay. Toggle row `[Bars] [Pulse]` in `MetronomeSheet`.
- **Sheet alignment** — shared `<Label>` component (`minWidth: 56px`) applied to every row in `MetronomeSheet`. Accel section now includes `stepBpm`, `every`, and `unit` controls so the ramp is configurable.

#### Today view — item rows
- **Tap to expand** — clicking the title area or chevron toggles the inline panel; previously only the chevron worked.
- **PDF icon inline** — `FileText` icon rendered next to the title if PDFs are present; tapping it opens `PdfDrawer` directly without opening the expand panel.
- **Expand panel order** — Reference track button → today's recording waveform → today's note (`MarkdownField`, editable) → persistent notes (`MarkdownField`, editable).

#### Tuning
- **`MobileDronePanel`** — separate component from desktop `DronePanel`. Full-width 64 px piano keyboard, stacked A=/Oct/Temperament rows (not flex-wrap), collapsible root selector + cent offset table. Desktop `DronePanel` unchanged.
- **Label** — `aria-label` on mobile drone toggle: `"Tuner"` → `"Tuning"`.

#### Recording
- **Soft mutex** — `handleStartRecording(type, itemId)` in `App.jsx`: same recording → stop; conflict → `mutexPrompt` inline banner above footer with Confirm/Cancel; idle → start. No modal.
- **MIME negotiation (15a)** — `preferredMime()` tries `audio/webm;codecs=opus → audio/mp4 → ''`; passed to `MediaRecorder` and `Blob`. `mimeType` stored in recording metadata.
- **Key collision fix (15g)** — piece recording IDB key: `${itemId}__${date}` → `${itemId}__${date}__${Date.now()}`. Stored as `idbKey` in metadata. All consumer call sites (`deletePieceRecording`, `applyFifo`, `attachDailyToPiece`, `PieceRecordingsPanel`, `RepertoireView`, `TodayView`) use `entry.idbKey ?? fallback`.

#### Audio — iOS fixes
- **15b** — `wactxRef.current?.resume()` added synchronously before `await ensure()` in `Waveform.play()`. Web Audio graph and gain ramp kept intact.
- **15c** — `audioCtxRef.current?.resume()` at top of metronome running branch and inside `toggleDrone`.
- **15d** — `computePeaks` (`media.js`) reuses a module-level `_peaksCtx` singleton instead of `new AudioContext()` per call; avoids hitting the 4-context iOS limit.
- **15e** — Drone frequency change uses `setValueAtTime` anchor + `exponentialRampToValueAtTime(freq, t+0.03)` to eliminate audible click on note change.

#### Waveform display
- **15f** — Removed second 2-pass smoothing in `Waveform` display component. `computePeaks` already smooths twice; the third pass was over-smoothing and flattening the shape.

#### Wiki links
- **CodeMirror editor** — direct DOM `addEventListener('touchstart', handler, {passive:false})` attached to the editor wrapper via `useEffect`. CodeMirror's `eventHandlers` cannot register non-passive listeners; this is the only mechanism that allows `preventDefault` to cancel iOS navigation.
- **Read-only markdown** — `MarkdownComponents <a>` already calls `e.preventDefault()` unconditionally; `onTouchStart` handler added with same logic.
- **`NotesMobile`** — plain `<a target="_blank">` links now also intercept `touchstart`.

## v0.97.5 — 2026-05-01

### Mobile adaptation (Tracks 1–9)

See UPDATE_LOG for user-facing summary. Full technical detail in the sprint branch.

---

## v0.97.0 — 2026-04-30

### Track 1 — Architecture & Navigation

- **Streak counter removed** — `calcStreak`, the flame glyph, and all streak state removed from every surface (Week, Month, footer, settings). The month calendar already shows consistency quietly; no replacement.
- **Review tab** — Week and Month views merged into a single Review tab. A scale selector at the top of the view switches between Week and Month; the last-used scale persists as `etudes-reviewScale`. Active scale carries a thin IKB underline; no pill, no border.
- **Seven-tab nav** — nav reduced from eight tabs to seven: Today · Review · Répertoire · Routines · Logs · Notes · Programs. Programs is last (after Notes), consistent with its role as a writing/reflection surface.
- **Mobile bottom nav updated** — week/month entries replaced with a single review entry.

### Track 2 — Programs View

- **Schema migration** — Programs records gain `venue`, `audience`, `itemNotes`, `intention`, `reflection`, and `body` fields. Migration runs unconditionally on every app load (idempotent via spread). `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to 10.
- **Programs list view** — sorted by `performanceDate` descending, undated last. Each row shows name, date, venue, piece count, and total duration. Empty state: *Nothing here yet.*
- **Program editor** — full editor with: name (inline edit, italic serif 32–36px); date, venue, and audience fields (audience is never exported and never displayed outside this editor); intention field (read-only once performance date is past — writable on the day itself); piece list with drag reorder and per-piece marginal annotations; reflection field (shows `—` for future dates, writable once date has passed or if null); free markdown Notes field with Edit/Preview toggle.
- **`selectedProgramId` lifted to `App.jsx`** — not local state in ProgramsView, so wiki-link navigation from Notes can reach it.
- **Wiki-link integration** — `resolveWikiLink` extended to resolve `program` and `note` types. `[[Program Name]]` from Notes navigates to the program editor. `[[Note Title]]` from Programs body navigates to Notes.

### Track 3 — Export

- **jszip installed** — ~100 KB bundle increase.
- **`src/lib/slug.js`** — `toSlug()` + `uniqueSlug()` with collision handling via `_2`, `_3` suffix.
- **ZIP export** — `Export journal` in Settings produces `études-export-YYYY-MM-DD.zip` containing: `journal/` (one `.md` per daily log, one per weekly/monthly reflection), `notes/`, `repertoire/`, `programs/`, `recordings/` (audio blobs with format-detected extension and `_locked` suffix), `scores/` (PDF blobs), `README.md`, and `_data.json`. Every `.md` file has YAML frontmatter and a human-readable body.
- **Audience privacy** — the `audience` field on program records is stripped from every exported file and from `_data.json` at serialisation time.
- **Platform-aware delivery** — uses `navigator.canShare` on iOS/Android (share sheet); falls back to direct download on desktop. `AbortError` (share sheet dismissed) is silently ignored.
- **Header `.md` chip removed** — one export path: the ZIP. `exportLog()` and drag handlers removed.
- **`exportJson()` and `importJsonFile()` preserved** — JSON backup/restore flow unchanged.

### Track 4 — Design System

- **`LINK` token annotated** in `src/constants/theme.js` — permitted use: docs HTML files only.
- **`WARM` token annotated** — permitted surfaces: rest timer, warm-up sessions, locked recording rows, A/B B-track waveform.
- **`REC = '#A93226'` added** — muted destructive for active recording state only.
- **All green eliminated** — `REF_COLOR = '#6B8F71'` and all `rgba(107,143,113,…)` replaced with `MUTED`; ref bar background (`#1a211a`) replaced with `SURFACE`; ref bar border replaced with `LINE_MED`; `--semantic-rest: #7A8F6A` removed from `index.css`.
- **Reference audio waveform** — `accentColor` changed to `MUTED` across `shared.jsx`, `App.jsx`, ref bar; no glow.
- **Display heading scale** — all seven view page headings now use `clamp(32px, 6vw, 56px)` — fixed in `DisplayHeader` (shared component), `WeekView`, `MonthView`, `LogsView`, `NotesView`.
- **Répertoire empty state** — corrected to *Nothing here yet.*

### Track 5 — Quality & Polish

- **Help modal** — shortcut list updated to reflect current state.
- **Docs** — `docs/guide.html` and `docs/index.html` updated: Review tab section replaces separate Week/Month sections; Programs section rewritten (salon journal framing, intention lock, reflection, wiki-links, audience privacy); Export section rewritten (ZIP structure, audio formats, platform delivery, privacy); "Recording on another device" placeholder removed and replaced with a factual statement.

### Track 6 — Copy & voice (May 2026)

- **Search placeholders** — Logs `Search logs…`; Répertoire main search `Search…`.
- **Réglages (Settings modal)** — Shorter daily-reminder footnote; tighter sync warning, Local only explainer, post-signup email copy, sign-in footnote; shorter full-backup sentence; **Shortcuts** tab descriptions shortened (e.g. Space → “Start or pause”, Esc → “Close”); **Sync conflict** buttons → `Keep this device` / `Keep cloud version` (less alarming). **HelpModal** shortcut text aligned with Settings where it mirrors the tab.
- **Today / Week / Month / Routines / Footer** — Placeholders shifted to declarative, calmer register (e.g. Today session note `What happened.`; reflection `How today felt. What surprised you.`).
- **Répertoire** — Single-example placeholders for collection/catalog; `Composer` / `Instrument` / `Link` field hints; log-book new-note placeholder `A note on this session.`; empty filtered log / empty log / piece-picker-adjacent empty → unified **`Nothing here yet.`**
- **Programs** — Empty piece-picker search → `Nothing here yet.` (same string as elsewhere).
- **Markdown deep-link hint** — `Custom links open in the installed app.`
- **Daily reminder notification** — Body → `Your practice journal is waiting.` (inviting, non-accusatory).
- **Dev / seed** — `seedTestNotes` sample titles: Prof. Lehmann; *Practicing* in Reverse; related seed bodies use Lehmann; DevTools seeded program notes → `Notes for {name}.`
- **Docs** — `docs/UI_TEXT_AUDIT.md` synced; guide/index sync conflict glossary terms match new button labels.

---

## v0.96.0 — 2026-04-30 (patch fixes)

- **`package.json` version sync** — Settings modal reads `appPkg.version` from `package.json` directly (not from `constants/config.js`); `package.json` was still at `0.95.7` while the footer badge showed `0.96.0` — both now read `0.96.0`
- **PWA `clientsClaim`** — added `clientsClaim: true` to Workbox config so the newly activated service worker immediately takes control of all open tabs; without it the new SW was installed in the background but waited for a full tab close/reopen before serving updated assets
- **Cloudflare CI fix (`.npmrc`)** — `vite-plugin-pwa@1.2.0` peer-depends on Vite ≤ 7 but the project uses Vite 8; Cloudflare's `npm clean-install` (strict mode) was rejecting this and failing every build since `9a11483`; `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` fixes it for both local installs and CI without touching the build command

## v0.96.0 — 2026-04-30

### Phase 2 — Mobile PWA Redesign

- **Service worker** (`vite-plugin-pwa`) — Workbox generates `sw.js` on every build; NetworkFirst for Supabase API calls, CacheFirst (1 year) for Google Fonts, full static asset precache; `registerType: autoUpdate`
- **`useViewport` hook** — ResizeObserver on `documentElement`; returns `{isMobile}` (true when viewport width < 768 px); replaces any `window.innerWidth` one-liners
- **Mobile bottom navigation** — fixed 8-tab bar (Today, Week, Month, Répertoire, Programs, Routines, Logs, Notes); 56 px + `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for iPhone home indicator; IKB active state with 2 px top border; min 44 px touch targets
- **Compact mobile header** — 44 px bar with 20 px italic logotype and a Settings icon; desktop 64 px header (clock, .md chip, Réglages, tab nav) unchanged
- **Mobile footer bar** — 52 px bar with live session timer + Stop button on the left; Rest / Record / Metronome / Drone icon buttons (44 px each) on the right; desktop footer bar unchanged
- **Répertoire on mobile** — Composers/Instruments sidebar renders as a full-screen overlay sheet (backdrop dismiss) instead of an inline aside; content uses `px-4 py-8`; A/B comparison bar adds `padding-bottom: 56 px` to clear the bottom nav
- **PDF score drawer on mobile** — edge-to-edge (no 24 px window inset); spots/bookmarks panel stacks below the PDF viewer as a 240 px panel instead of a side column

### Phase 1 — UX & documentation (completed)

- **Apple Sign-In button** — re-added alongside Google in the auth modal; renders conditionally when `signInWithApple` prop is provided
- **`docs/guide.html` fixes** — §03 nav ceiling clarified ("Programs is an eighth view, deliberately outside it"); §24 cross-device audio section expanded with explicit "Recording on another device" placeholder explanation
- **`docs/index.html`** — synced to match `guide.html` (was 18 lines behind)

## v0.95.6 — 2026-04-28

### Logs view — unified card layout & visual differentiation

- **Unified card shell** — all three card types (Daily / Weekly / Monthly) now share identical border (`1px solid LINE`), padding (`p-6`), background (`transparent`), and hover state (`background → SURFACE`, `120ms` transition); no more three different border weights
- **2 px top accent** — sole visual differentiator per type: Daily = `IKB` blue, Weekly = `DIM` neutral, Monthly = `LINE_STR` near-invisible — subtle enough not to dominate
- **Date as hero** — all cards promote their primary date/period to `52px` italic serif with a unified structure:
  - Daily: month name as `13px MUTED italic` prefix line + day number at `52px`
  - Weekly: month context prefix line + day-range hero (`21 — 27`); cross-month weeks show abbreviated months as prefix (`Mar — Apr`)
  - Monthly: month name at `52px`
- **Minutes demoted** — daily card's `36px IKB` minutes block and its divider removed; replaced by a right-aligned `11px mono MUTED` badge in the eyebrow row
- **Eyebrow consistency** — all type labels (`DAILY`, `WEEKLY REFLECTION`, `MONTHLY REFLECTION`) now use `FAINT 10px uppercase 0.28em` tracking; no more `IKB` on eyebrow labels

## v0.95.5 — 2026-04-28

### Reference track — Today view pull-up bar

- **T3 pull-up bar** — a slide-up panel (matching the Recording panel layout) appears above the Footer when a reference track is active; `SURFACE`-equivalent green-tinted background (`#1a211a`) clearly distinguishes it from the warm Recording panel
- **"REFERENCE FOR · piece title"** header with the piece name inline, mirroring the Recording panel's label + detail pattern; × close button top-right
- **Full-width waveform** — `Waveform` rendered at full panel width with Play / Pause / Rewind controls; speed slider integrated flush with the Rewind button as an `actions` row element
- **Varispeed: 25–100%, 1% granularity** — slider width 140 px, `step=0.01`; speed resets to 100% on each new item activation
- **Pull-up animation** — `max-height` + `translateY` CSS transition combo gives a true bottom-sheet slide-in without covering the Footer; state lifted to `useEtudesState` so App.jsx owns the bar position in the normal document flow (above Footer, never overlapping it)
- **Music note trigger** — compact ♪ button in each Today item row activates/deactivates the bar for that item; tinted green when active

### Reference track — Repertoire view (PieceRecordingsPanel)

- **Recording-style card** — `RefTrackPlayer` restyled with `border: 1px solid LINE_STR`, `padding: 12px 14px 14px`, transparent background; matches the recording preview section layout
- **Header row** — `REF` label in green mono + filename in MUTED mono (mirrors `PREVIEW` + date in recording cards)
- **Controls** — full `Waveform` (non-compact, 40 px) replaces the previous compact inline version; speed slider + Replace + Delete buttons rendered as `actions` in the Waveform button row, flush with Rewind
- **Drag-and-drop upload** — border shifts to dashed green on file drag; "drop to replace" hint appears inline; audio formats: mp3, wav, flac, m4a
- **Varispeed: 25–100%, 5% steps** in the Repertoire inline player; 1% steps in the Today pull-up bar

### Notes view — layout fixes & sidebar improvements

- **Sidebar alignment** — categories sidebar now starts level with the note list (below the search bar); the header ("NOTES" eyebrow + italic `h1`) is lifted above the two-column flex row and offset to align with the content column
- **Note list scroll** — note list is now bounded to the viewport height (`calc(100vh - 310px)`) with its own `overflow-y-auto` scrollbar; sidebar and note list bottom edges align
- **Sidebar collapse toggle** — sidebar can now be collapsed via a "Collapse" chevron button (top-right of sidebar); a **Filter** button appears in the search bar to restore it; mirrors the Repertoire view pattern
- **Collapse affordance** — the collapse chevron (`w-3.5`) shows "Collapse" label on hover with `120ms` fade

### Repertoire view — sidebar collapse affordance

- Collapse chevron enlarged to `w-3.5`; "Collapse" label fades in on hover, matching Notes view

### Notes view — link fixes

- **Wiki links in preview mode** — `[[title]]` links are now clickable in preview (ReactMarkdown) mode: body is pre-processed to convert `[[text]]` → `[text](wiki://text)`, intercepted in the custom `a` renderer and routed through `handleWikiClick`
- **External links in edit mode** — **Ctrl/Cmd+Click** on any markdown link `[text](url)` or bare `https://` URL in the CodeMirror editor now opens it in a new tab; trailing punctuation stripped from captured URLs
- **External link protocol guard** — links written without a protocol (e.g. `google.com`) auto-prepend `https://` in preview mode

### Repertoire view — button rename

- "Facets" sidebar toggle renamed to **"Filter"** for clarity

## v0.95.4 — 2026-04-28

### Week & Month views — temporal navigation

- **W1 — Week navigation** — back / forward chevrons inline with the eyebrow date range in Week view; navigates to any past week; title switches from *"This week"* to the specific range (`Apr 20 — 26`; cross-month: `Mar 30 — Apr 5`); weekly Ring uses live `weekActualSeconds` for the current week and sums from `history` for past weeks; reflection fields hidden for past weeks
- **W2 — Month navigation** — same pattern in Month view; monthly Ring recomputed from history for past months; reflection fields hidden for past months; "Now" button restores current period
- **W3 — Bar chart hover** — hovering a day column in Week view brightens the bar to IKB blue tint, lifts minute label and weekday label to IKB; `0.12s` transitions
- **W4 — Calendar cell hover** — hovering a day cell in Month view fills with `rgba(0,47,167,0.08)` blue wash, turns day number and minute label IKB, strengthens the left-edge activity bar; `0.12s` transitions

### Routines view — collapsed row styling

- Routine title promoted to `1.4rem` italic serif with `TEXT` color as the dominant element
- Session type labels reduced to `9px DIM uppercase`; counts at `opacity:0.6`; separators at `opacity:0.5`
- Collapsed row padding tightened to `py-4` with `items-center` alignment

### Notes view — UI/UX cleanup (design system alignment)

- **Collapsible sidebar** — Archives, Folders, and Tags sections are now independently collapsible with ChevronUp/Down toggles matching the RepertoireView `SidebarFacet` pattern; folder count badge shown in section header; "New folder" input moved inside the expanded Folders section; redundant "Notes" section label removed
- **Dynamic title** — the 56px italic serif `h1` now reflects the active context: *Notes*, *Daily Reflections*, *Repertoire Logs*, folder name, or `#tag`; static "NOTES" eyebrow provides section context
- **Search bar** — `borderTop` removed; single `borderBottom` hairline only, matching design system `.input` pattern
- **New button placement** — moved from the page header into the top of the note list column alongside a note count label
- **Note list** — per-item `#tag` chips removed; body snippet font changed from italic serif to `sans FAINT`; subtle IKB blue hover tint (`rgba(0,47,167,0.04)`); active row uses `IKB_SOFT` background with `2px IKB` left border
- **Note editor** — `Trash2` delete icon removed from the title row; "Delete note" text link added at the bottom of the editor below a hairline separator, following the Repertoire expanded-panel pattern
- **Preview / Edit toggle** — `Eye` / `Pencil` button right-aligned in the meta row; preview mode renders body through `ReactMarkdown` with full GFM (headings, bold, italic, lists, blockquotes, code, links); title becomes a static heading; folder picker collapses to a plain label; delete footer hidden in preview
- **Vertical divider** — hairline `1px LINE` rule between the note list and editor columns
- **Button alignment** — tag pills and "New folder" button aligned to design system hairline button style (`LINE_MED` border, `3px` radius, `0.14em` tracking)

## v0.95.3 — 2026-04-28

### Notes & Logging Architecture ("Single Entry, Multiple Echo")

- **N1 — Markdown everywhere** — all text fields (pinned notes, session notes, daily/weekly/monthly reflections, spot notes, free notes, log book entries) now have an Edit / Preview toggle. Preview renders Markdown in a serif font with full GFM support (bold, italic, headings, lists, code, tables, horizontal rules).
- **N2 — Deep-link support** — standard `https://` links open in a new tab; `obsidian://` and `x-devonthink-item://` deep links open via `window.open`. Fields that contain custom links display a faint one-line hint: *"Custom links open in the desktop app if installed."*
- **N3 — Per-piece Log Book** — in Repertoire view, the plain `detail` textarea is replaced by a two-section panel: a pinned **Pinned notes** field (the existing `detail`, now a `MarkdownField`) and a scrollable **Log Book** showing all dated session notes for that piece, newest first. Features: inline edit, delete, text filter bar, and a manual "+ Add note" form for retrospective entries.
- **Composite daily lock** — on day rollover, each item's `todayNote` is pushed as a timestamped `{source: 'session'}` entry into `item.noteLog`. The day's `history[].reflection` is now a composite Markdown string: user's free reflection → `---` separator → `### Piece Title` sections for each item that had a note.
- **Composite reflection rendered in Logs** — the `DayLogContent` drawer in Logs view renders the composite reflection as Markdown (supports headings, horizontal rules, links).

### Notes Tab revamp

- **Category sidebar** — persistent left sidebar with standard read-only categories (Daily Reflections, Repertoire Logs) and user-defined folders. Folders can be created, renamed, and deleted inline. Notes get a `category` field; changing folder is a one-click dropdown in the note editor.
- **Tag system** — `#tag` syntax parsed from note bodies at save time. A tag cloud in the sidebar shows all tags with counts; clicking a tag filters the note list. Tags are also rendered as inline clickable chips in preview mode.
- **`[[wiki-link]]` fuzzy resolution** — type `[[Chopin Waterfall]]` and it resolves to the best matching repertoire item using slug-based fuzzy matching (strips punctuation, scores by exact slug / all words / any word). `[[2026-04-28]]` opens the Log Drawer for that date. `[[Piece #Spot]]` resolves to a specific spot. Unresolved links render as faint italic `[[text]]?` with a tooltip. Clicking a resolved link navigates to Repertoire or opens the Log Drawer.
- **Daily Reflections view** — shows the last 30 daily history entries rendered as Markdown, newest first.
- **Repertoire Logs view** — shows all `noteLog` entries across all items, filterable by piece name.

### Data model

- Schema version bumped 7 → 8; migration adds `noteLog: []` to all existing items.
- New `noteCategories` state (array of strings) persisted to `localStorage` under `etudes-noteCategories`.
- New `src/lib/notes.js` — exports: `slugify`, `scoreMatch`, `resolveWikiLink`, `parseTagsFromBody`, `buildCompositeDailyReflection`.
- `freeNotes` entries gain `category` (string) and `tags` (string[]) fields, parsed automatically on save.

## v0.95.0-beta — 2026-04-27

### PDF Score System (P1–P6)

- **P1 — All repertoire types** — PDF upload, reference link, and the "Add score" button are no longer restricted to Pieces; all four types (Technique, Pieces, Play, Study) now support scores
- **P2 — Bookmarks** — add named bookmarks at any page within a PDF attachment; bookmarks appear as a ribbon overlay on the page in all view modes; a dedicated toolbar button shows a popover with the full bookmark list (jump to any), current-page bookmarks highlighted, and an inline add form (name + current page, press Enter or +)
- **P3 — Viewer controls** — replaced the `<iframe>` with a full `react-pdf` viewer; toolbar includes: fit-to-width, fit-to-page, zoom in/out with % indicator, single-page mode, two-page spread mode (shows current page + next side-by-side), continuous scroll mode; page indicator shows current page / total; all toolbar icons have hover labels via portal tooltip (works through overflow clipping)
- **P4 — Resizable sidebar** — drag the handle between the viewer and sidebar to resize (220–520 px range); expand/minimize button in header toggles edge-to-edge fullscreen
- **P5 — Shared score library** — uploading a PDF creates a library entry (`libraryId`); the same file can be attached to multiple items via "From library" in the tab bar, each with its own page range (`startPage`, `endPage`); deleting an attachment only removes the blob from storage when no other item still references that `libraryId`
- **P6 — Spot ↔ bookmark link** — in SpotEditor (Repertoire), a "→ bookmark" dropdown lists all bookmarks across the item's attachments; selecting one stores `bookmarkId` + `pdfAttachmentId` on the spot; when a linked spot becomes active while PdfDrawer is open, it auto-switches to the correct attachment tab and jumps to the bookmark's page

### Data model

- Schema version bumped from 6 → 7; existing attachment `{id, name}` shape automatically migrated to `{id, libraryId, name, startPage, endPage, bookmarks: []}` on first load
- Spots gain optional `bookmarkId` and `pdfAttachmentId` fields (null by default, backward-compatible)
- New `pdfLibrary` global state (persisted to `localStorage`) tracks all uploaded PDF blobs independent of which items reference them

## v0.93.5 — 2026-04-27

### Recording

- **R1** — Replaced the mic icon next to the RECORD label in the footer with a playback (▶) button that opens the recording panel
- **R2** — Elapsed recording time displayed in red mono font in the footer bar and as a pulsing counter in the pull-up panel while recording is active
- **R3 — Context-aware recording** — pressing Record while a piece timer is running records directly into that piece; otherwise records to the daily session log. Footer button label changes to "Rec piece" when a piece is active
- **Attach daily recording to piece** — in the recording panel, a dropdown lists all pieces in the current routine; selecting one and clicking Attach moves the daily recording into that piece's archive and resets the daily recording

### Keyboard shortcuts

- **K1** — All shortcut-enabled UI elements now show the assigned key in a styled tooltip on hover: `Space` (Stop timer), `R` (Rest), `M` (Metronome), `T` (Tap tempo), `L` (Log BPM), `D` (Tuning), `N` (Quick note), `?` (Réglages)

### Tuning panel

- **TU1** — `D` keyboard shortcut now opens/closes the tuning panel directly (was: toggle drone audio)
- **TU3** — Play · Vol · Pitch reference · Temperament · Octave all consolidated onto a single controls line, reducing panel height significantly
- **TU4** — Note selector redesigned as a piano keyboard: 7 white keys and 5 black keys in correct piano layout; selected note highlighted in IKB; temperament offset dots on affected keys; note names at the bottom of each key

## v0.93 — 2026-04-26

### Audio recording — waveform scrubbing & per-piece archive

#### Waveform scrubbing
- Replaced static bar-chart waveform with smooth SVG bezier curve using cubic interpolation
- Real drag-to-scrub: playhead follows mouse during drag; audio seeks on mouseup and resumes if was playing
- Transport controls redesigned as standard **Play · Pause · Rewind** row above the waveform
- Live time counter (`0:13 / 4:50`) right-aligned in the transport row, updates during scrub
- Re-record button moved into the transport row (alongside Play/Pause/Rewind)
- Peak extraction upgraded: 120 buckets (was 60), RMS per bucket (was peak-max), 2-pass weighted smoothing — smoother, perceptually accurate waveform
- Day recording drawer moved to footer pull-up panel (same pattern as metronome/tuner)

#### Per-piece recording archive
- New `pieceRecordings` IndexedDB store (DB version bumped to 2); metadata persisted to localStorage as `etudes-pieceRecordingMeta`
- Each recording keyed `{itemId}__{date}`, tagged with BPM (from metronome at record time) and stage
- **Recordings panel** in Répertoire expanded view: reverse-chronological list with compact scrubbable waveform per entry, date/BPM/stage badges, delete
- **A/B comparison**: select any two recordings as A and B — side-by-side full waveforms with independent play/pause/rewind/scrub; no forced sync
- **Mic button per item** in Today view (next to play button) — records directly to the piece archive; dims when another recording is active
- Today's recording for a piece appears as a compact scrubbable waveform inside the item's expanded drawer (Today section), not on the collapsed row

## v0.91 — 2026-04-26

### Fixes & polish

- **Sync reliability** — debounce reduced from 30 s to 5 s; all sync paths (stop, close day, tab hide, reconnect) now update the status indicator correctly
- **Sync Now button** — manual sync trigger in Réglages → Sync; doubles as status indicator (Syncing… / Sync error); last synced time shown inline under the account email
- **Sync conflict resolution** — signing in on a device with unsynced local data now shows a three-option modal: Merge (union by ID), Keep local, or Keep cloud. Prevents pieces being silently overwritten on first cross-device sign-in
- **Réglages layout** — tab order changed to Settings → Shortcuts → Sync → Export → About; Storage indicator moved from Settings into Sync tab
- **Input overflow** — number inputs (target fields) no longer escape modal boundary; browser spinner arrows removed globally
- **Signup confirmation** — after account creation, shows "Check your inbox" state with email address instead of blank form
- **Deployment** — removed Vite `base: '/app/'`; added `_redirects` SPA fallback; app now serves correctly from domain root on Cloudflare Pages

---

## v0.90.1 — 2026-04-25

### Cloud sync via Supabase

- Optional sign-in in Réglages → Sync (email/password; no account required to use the app)
- Two-tier sync: cold state debounced 30 s; hot state (timers) flushed only on stop, day close, tab hide, or reconnect
- All 18 localStorage effects untouched — cloud sync is purely additive
- First-run migration modal on first sign-in
- Sync status indicator (idle / syncing / synced / error)
- Blob guards: PDFs and recordings show "Attached on another device" rather than silently failing

---

## v0.9.0 — 2026-04-25

### Design system

- Études Design System tokens across all UI: color, type, spacing
- True IKB `#002FA7`, correct ivory text, brass warm accent
- All glow and drop-shadow effects removed
- Cormorant Garamond, EB Garamond, Inter, JetBrains Mono loaded via Google Fonts
- Monospace font applied to all tabular numerics
