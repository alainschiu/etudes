# Update Log

## v0.97.0 — 2026-05-01

- **Calmer copy** — placeholders and Settings text tightened across Today, Review (week/month), Routines, Répertoire, Logs search, and the footer quick-note bar; empty lists that used different phrases now say **Nothing here yet.** in one voice
- **Réglages** — shorter reminder and sync explainers; sync conflict choices renamed to **Keep this device** and **Keep cloud version**; shortcut help text simplified in Settings and Help
- **Daily reminder** — notification wording is inviting instead of implying you failed to practice
- **User guide** — conflict-resolution terms updated to match the new sync buttons

## v0.96.0 — 2026-04-30

- **Works offline** — the app installs as a PWA and caches all assets; loads instantly on repeat visits with no network connection needed
- **Mobile bottom navigation** — on phones, a fixed bottom tab bar replaces the desktop header tabs; eight tabs with icons; respects iPhone home indicator

- **Répertoire on mobile** — the Composers/Instruments filter panel slides in as a full-screen overlay instead of pushing the layout
- **PDF viewer on mobile** — score viewer fills the full screen; spots and bookmarks panel slides below the PDF

## v0.95.7 — 2026-04-28

- **Daily reminder** — optional push notification at a chosen time; toggle and time picker in Settings → Settings
- **Export as primary action** — Export .md is now a full-width button in Settings → Export; secondary formats remain
- **Intention in Today** — when a routine is loaded, each session shows its practice intention in dim italic below the section header
- **Recording archive** — piece recordings use a FIFO rolling archive (10 slots); soft warning at 7, hard warning at 9; recordings can be locked to exempt them from the rolling limit (max 20 locked)
- **Cross-device placeholder** — when a recording or PDF exists on another device, the entry shows a dashed-stroke placeholder instead of an empty gap

- **Notes & Logging** — composite daily reflection rendered as Markdown in Logs view `DayLogContent`
- **Notes Tab revamp** — left sidebar with standard categories (Daily Reflections, Repertoire Logs) and user-defined folders; `#tag` cloud with click-to-filter; `[[wiki-link]]` fuzzy resolution (slug-based, date / piece / spot); Note editor has pen/eye preview toggle + folder picker + tag display
