# Update Log

## v0.97.9 — 2026-05-03

- **Google Drive (early)** — Settings → Sync includes **Connect Google Drive** using Google’s sign-in (separate from your Supabase account). Full backup to Drive is still being built; this release wires the first step so we can verify your OAuth client.
- **Apple sign-in removed** — Sign in is email or Google only.

## v0.97.8 — 2026-05-02

- **PWA — offline in the header** — on mobile, the top bar shows a small **Offline** indicator when the device has no network (so you know why sync or uploads may not work, even though the app shell can still run from cache)
- **PWA — gentler updates** — when a new version is published, a small bar at the bottom offers **Reload** or **Later** instead of the tab switching over without warning
- **PWA — offline PDF worker** — the score viewer’s worker file is cached with the rest of the app so PDFs are more likely to open after you have used the app online once, then go offline
- **PWA — install card** — the web manifest now includes a short description and explicit scope/language fields for clearer install / store-style listings where the browser shows them

## v0.97.7 — 2026-05-02

- **Metronome — tempo matches the “Note” you pick** — BPM now follows the beat unit (e.g. eighth vs quarter), including in compound time, so the click spacing matches what you expect on the score
- **Metronome — steadier when you tweak settings** — changing BPM, beats, subdivision, or sound while the metronome runs no longer resets the whole pulse; compound 6/8-style setups apply subdivisions as soon as you use **Auto** without restarting
- **Metronome — clearer clicks** — click sound is shorter and more percussive (less like a held pitch)
- **Metronome — optional accent pattern** — in the metronome drawer (and the desktop Réglages metronome panel), when you have more than two beats per bar, you can tap beats to mark which ones get a stronger accent; **Reset** returns to automatic accents
- **Metronome — Auto for compound** — turning **Auto** **On** folds 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 beats (with one subdivision per beat and Group Off) into a triple-compound layout; leaving **Auto** off keeps six equal beats if that is what you want; changing the **Note** value alone does not trigger that fold
- **Metronome sheet** — subdivision row shows plain **1 2 3 4** (plus dotted option) for readability; preset meter chips removed in favour of Auto + manual controls

## v0.97.6 — 2026-05-01

- **Metronome widget (mobile)** — beat bars are now the dominant visual element; whole left zone (bars + BPM/time sig) is a single touch target that toggles the metronome; time signature rendered larger; chevron opens the sheet as before
- **Pulse mode** — new visual mode for the metronome widget: the entire box flashes briefly on each beat instead of showing bars. Beat 1 fires in IKB with a glow; other beats flash at reduced opacity. Toggle between Bars and Pulse in the metronome drawer.
- **Metronome sheet (mobile)** — all control rows (Beats, Note, Sub, Sound, Vol, Accel) now share a consistent left-aligned label column; accelerando section exposes the Step and Every inputs so the ramp is actually configurable on mobile
- **Today view items (mobile)** — tapping anywhere on an item row opens the inline edit panel (no longer requires the chevron); PDF icon appears inline next to the title and opens the score directly; expand panel shows Reference track, today's recording, today's note, and persistent notes in that order
- **Tuning panel (mobile)** — dedicated `MobileDronePanel` layout: full-width 64 px piano keyboard, stacked A=/Oct/Temperament rows, collapsible root + offset table; desktop panel unchanged
- **Audio — iOS playback fixes** — `AudioContext.resume()` called on user gesture for metronome, drone, and waveform playback (fixes silent audio on first tap on iOS); MIME type negotiation (`webm;codecs=opus → mp4 → fallback`) for `MediaRecorder` so recordings are playable on all platforms
- **Audio — recording key collision** — piece recording IDB keys now include a timestamp suffix (`itemId__date__ts`) so same-day re-records no longer silently overwrite each other
- **Audio — drone note change** — frequency transitions use an exponential ramp (30 ms) instead of an instant set, eliminating the audible click on note change
- **Audio — waveform context limit** — `computePeaks` reuses a single module-level `AudioContext` instead of creating a new one per call (was hitting the 4-context iOS limit after a few recordings)
- **Waveform display** — removed the redundant second smoothing pass in the display component (peaks are already smoothed twice in `computePeaks`); waveforms are slightly crisper
- **Wiki links (mobile)** — `[[wiki-link]]` taps in the CodeMirror editor now use a direct non-passive `touchstart` DOM listener so `preventDefault` is called before iOS initiates navigation; read-only markdown links also intercept `touchstart` to prevent the SPA reload that was jumping back to Today
- **Recording soft mutex** — starting a new recording while one is already running shows an inline "Stop current and start new?" confirmation banner above the footer instead of silently failing or using a modal

## v0.97.5 — 2026-05-01

- **Mobile navigation** — hamburger drawer replaces the bottom tab bar; primary views (Today, Répertoire, Programs, Logs, Notes) show icon + label + eyebrow; Review and Routines as secondary items; Export and Réglages as utility actions
- **Today on mobile** — accordion sections, target progress bar, item rows with pulse dot when active, collapsible reflection, close-the-day pill
- **Footer on mobile** — three-row transport: readout strip (active item + elapsed), Play/Pause · metronome widget · Record · Plus, status strip with today total and rest toggle; metronome opens a full bottom sheet
- **Répertoire on mobile** — list view with filter sheet; tap a piece to open a full detail screen with Spots, Info, Recordings, and Score tabs
- **Notes on mobile** — folder chip strip, search, expand-in-place, edit bottom sheet
- **Logs on mobile** — vertical day list grouped by month, 2px section bar per day, reflection excerpt; taps open the existing log drawer
- **Programs, Routines, Review on mobile** — reduced padding, minimum 44px touch targets throughout
- **Typography (all screens)** — display headings weight 400; Répertoire and Today item titles in EB Garamond italic; reading prose (reflections, notes, spot annotations) in EB Garamond
- **PWA** — iOS home screen meta tags; manifest theme colour aligned to app background; icon `any maskable`

## v0.97.0 — 2026-05-01

- **Calmer copy** — placeholders and Settings text tightened across Today, Review (week/month), Routines, Répertoire, Logs search, and the footer quick-note bar; empty lists that used different phrases now say **Nothing here yet.** in one voice
- **Réglages** — shorter reminder and sync explainers; sync conflict choices renamed to **Keep this device** and **Keep cloud version**; shortcut help text simplified in Settings and Help
- **Daily reminder** — notification wording is inviting instead of implying you failed to practice
- **User guide** — conflict-resolution terms updated to match the new sync buttons

## v0.96.0 — 2026-04-30

- **Works offline** — the app installs as a PWA and caches all assets; loads instantly on repeat visits with no network connection needed
- **Mobile bottom navigation** — on phones, a fixed bottom tab bar replaces the desktop header tabs; eight tabs with icons; respects iPhone home indicator

- **Répertoire on mobile** — the Composers/Instruments filter panel slides in as a full-screen overlay instead of pushing the layout
- **PDF viewer on mobile** — score viewer fills the full screen; spots and bookmarks panel slides below the PDF
- **Apple Sign-In** — sign in with Apple alongside Google and email

## v0.95.7 — 2026-04-28

- **Daily reminder** — optional push notification at a chosen time; toggle and time picker in Settings → Settings
- **Export as primary action** — Export .md is now a full-width button in Settings → Export; secondary formats remain
- **Intention in Today** — when a routine is loaded, each session shows its practice intention in dim italic below the section header
- **Recording archive** — piece recordings use a FIFO rolling archive (10 slots); soft warning at 7, hard warning at 9; recordings can be locked to exempt them from the rolling limit (max 20 locked)
- **Cross-device placeholder** — when a recording or PDF exists on another device, the entry shows a dashed-stroke placeholder instead of an empty gap
- **Sync payload warning** — a banner in Settings → Sync appears when the cloud backup exceeds 500 KB, suggesting an export before the limit is reached
